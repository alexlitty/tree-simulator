# Tree Simulator
This is a game where you are a tree.

I can't explain it any better. Frankly, I'm not sure what else you were expecting.

# Purpose & License

This is a prototype of a potential video game project. It received quite a lot of time, thought, and personal attention. It stands today with a decently playable foundation.

I've stopped developing it to pursue bigger projects. It is open to the public to be forked and expanded by anyone interested in bringing the game to fruition, for commercial purposes and otherwise. I only require a credit for the initial concept and foundation.
