# Tree Simulator
This is a game where you are a tree.

I can't explain it any better and I'm not sure what else you were expecting.

This is a prototype of a game concept I'd like to pursue one day. This version is made available for *educational purposes only*. The prototype, or any alterations of it, may not be redistributed personally nor commercially.
